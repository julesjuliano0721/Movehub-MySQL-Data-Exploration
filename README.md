## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to explore and discover key insights within datasets provided to us by Movehub, a company that uses data-driven decisions to help people relocate internationally. We will be using MySQL to further develop a better understanding of patterns and trends based on the data made available to us.



## Data

Movehub shared three datasets with us:

 - movehubqol.csv
 - movehubcol.csv
 - cities.csv


### Content

Cities ranked by:

 - **Movehub Rating**: A combination of all scores for an overall rating for a city or country.

 - **Purchase Power**: This compares the average cost of living with the average local wage.

 - **Health Care**: Compiled from how citizens feel about their access to healthcare, and its quality.

 - **Pollution**: Low is good. A score of how polluted people find a city, includes air, water and noise pollution.

 - **Quality of Life**: A balance of healthcare, pollution, purchase power, crime rate to give an overall quality of life score.
